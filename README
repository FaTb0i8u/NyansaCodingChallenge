Challenge 1:
In order to run the challenge, just run the file using Python (python nyansaCoding1.py) and you will be prompted for an input file. I already supplied a input.txt file based on the example given in the specs of the challenge so you could just input that. The space and time complexity are inside the python file.

Challenge 2:
The second challenge is simply a text document. There is no need to build.

Thank you for your time and have a wonderful day.
